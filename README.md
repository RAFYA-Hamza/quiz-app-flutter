# My First Flutter App {Quiz App}

Welcome to my first app using Flutter! It's been a great experience for me to discover a new field that I'm passionate about. This app is designed to provide a simple yet engaging way to learn some basics about Flutter through a quiz format.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: The app starts with a splash screen that contains some useful information about the app.
